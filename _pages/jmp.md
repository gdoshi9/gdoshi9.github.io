Transitioning to an electricity grid that fully realizes the benefits from renewable energy will require substantial investment in transmission lines. This paper examines the short- and long-run effects of large scale grid expansion projects aimed at enhancing the integration of wind energy in the US. I focus on the rollout of a large scale transmission expansion project in Texas for my empirical analysis. Short-run analysis shows that transmission expansion led to a 2-2.5% decline in markups during the peak demand hours and a 7% decline during the off peak hours. Transmission expansion also prevented about \$51 million worth of annual damages (2020 \$) from marginal emissions in the short-run.  In the long-run, transmission expansion on an average led to higher wind capacity (+202%), more turbines (+245%), and bigger wind projects (+121%) in counties that received investment in transmission infrastructure. Given a growing need for investment in grid expansion in the US, this paper provides evidence of significant market impacts in the short- and the long-run in response to grid expansion.
